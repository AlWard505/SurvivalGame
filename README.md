# SurvivalGame
Hiya,

to use this you run the file named "main", this will then open up a window

from this point you need to create a new game by going into "file" and then "new"

this will prompt you to add a name for the savefile and wether or not you want "fog of war"

if you want to continue click continue then select the savefile you want to open

to exit, avoid clicking the red X button unless you have clicked the save button beforehand

saving will occur if you click the "Save" button or the "Save & Quit" button

if you want fog of war in your game then you can select the option when creating it
this will limit you to what you have discovered and not let you travel too far too quickly
